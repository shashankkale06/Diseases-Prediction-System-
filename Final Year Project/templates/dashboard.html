                    <p>Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart rhythm issues, and heart defects. It's the leading cause of death worldwide, often resulting from unhealthy lifestyle choices and can be managed through lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery in severe cases.</p>

                    <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                    <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy, involving issues with insulin production or use. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, while Type 2, more common, is often related to lifestyle factors. Managing blood sugar levels through diet, exercise, medication, or insulin is crucial to prevent complications like heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney failure.</p>

                    <h4>Lung Cancer</h4>
                    <h5><p>Lung cancer, one of the most common and serious types of cancer, primarily affects the cells lining the lungs. The main cause is smoking, though non-smokers can also develop lung cancer, often due to exposure to radon gas, asbestos, or other pollutants. Early detection can significantly improve prognosis through treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.</p></h5>

                    <h4>Chronic Kidney Disease</h4>
                    <p>Chronic kidney disease is the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It can lead to the accumulation of waste products in the blood, making it hard to regulate blood pressure, electrolytes, and fluid in the body. CKD is often caused by diabetes and high blood pressure and may progress to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.</p>
